## Description 

Our app takes a user's location input. This information is used to pull weather data from OpenWeather.org. Temperature information for the location is then used behind the scenes to determine likely available drink ingredients. The drink ingredients are then used to pull selected/suggested drinks form the CocktailDB. A list/table below the input is then populated with the location name, temperature, and suggested drinks and images of them.
