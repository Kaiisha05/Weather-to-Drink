# Weather to Drink or Not? That is the Question.

## Team 

* Lavar Cole
* Jon Bodnar
* Aruna Kolli
* Kaiisha Oliver

## Description 

### Basic 

Our app takes a user's location input. This information is used to pull weather data from OpenWeather.org. Temperature information for the location is then used behind the scenes to determine likely available drink ingredients. The drink ingredients are then used to pull selected/suggested drinks from the CocktailDB. A list/table below the input is then populated with the location name, temperature, and suggested drinks and images of them.

### Beyond the Basic

* Store responses to localStorage, allow keeping/deleting
* Add a button so that people can pull chuck norris facts
* Use browser geolocation to let user pull location based on current location (lat and lon) with one button click
